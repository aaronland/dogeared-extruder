dropwizard-extruder
==

This is a meant to be a simple HTTP Pony to wrap the `boilerpipe` and `Tika`
text extraction libraries using the `dropwizard` framework. Ideally the `readbility` algorithm too.

It does not work yet. I am not a Java person so I am still trying to fumble my
way around this foreign land.

Should this:

* Always return plain text
* Always return HTML
* Always return JSON blobs containing "paragraphs"
